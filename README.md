#App from Scratch - Pomodoro Power

In this repo you will find the code that was created whilst filming the App from scratch video
[The Reactionary.net youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHgDwCRp7T311ItY0XCUhGA) where we built the Pomodoro
power app. Click the link and have a quick look through the videos and you'll find it on the channel.

To make this code work you'll need to clone down the repo, run an npm install. From there it's a simple matter of running
the npm start command. Following the instructions on the video will aid you getting the whole thing uploaded to Heroku if
you so wish.

If you have any questions or comments about the code please don't hesitate to contact me on any of my social
media which you can find at the top of the page at [thereactionary.net](http://thereactionary.net)
